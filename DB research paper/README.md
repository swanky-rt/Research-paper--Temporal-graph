Temporal Graph Research - Relational to Dynamic Graph Pipeline

This repository contains ongoing research work under the supervision of Professor Marco and Md Ashraful Islam (Ph.D.) on temporal graphs.

Overview

The focus of this research is to develop a pipeline for converting relational databases into dynamic graph structures. This transformation enables the application of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) to effectively model:

Asynchronous interactions

Evolving dependencies across relational entities

Our goal is to explore how TGNNs can be leveraged in real-world scenarios where data evolves over time and relationships are not static.

Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This is an active research project. The codebase is currently under development and may undergo significant changes.
